# SpaceYaTech Mentorship Program

The SpaceYaTech Mentorship Program is our flagship mentorship program. The program is designed to be flexible and is tailored to meet the needs of developers looking to learn JavaScript, CSS and HTML. 

We employ a practical approach to our teaching process; we help mentees by building mini projects that allow them to put into practice what they learn, as we teach therotetical concepts of web development. This way, mentees get a good grasp of what they learn and can quickly apply them in their day-to-day web development tasks and achieve their career goals.

We have a team of mentors who are experts in their fields and are willing to share their knowledge and experience with mentees.

## Why a Mentorship Program?
[SpaceYaTech](https://www.spaceyatech.com/) is now one of the fastest growing tech communities in Kenya. This is down to the twitter spaces that we hold every Thursdays from 8PM EAT. 

The spaces revolve around a multitude of tech topics, from landing your first job in tech, to the current state of tech to the latest tech trends. 
We invite industry experts to share their knowledge and experience with the community.

As a result of this, we have had a lot of requests from people who want to join the tech industry but don't know where to start. We have also had requests from people who want to learn a new skill or improve on their current skillset. 

This is the why behind the mentorship program. A way to give back to the community and help people achieve their goals.
