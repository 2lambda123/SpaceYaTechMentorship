# SpaceYaTech Mentorship Program

We recently launched our flagship mentorship program, the SpaceYaTech Mentorship Program. The program is designed to be flexible and is tailored to meet the needs of the mentees. 
We take a step by step approach to help mentees achieve their goals, by building mini projects that allow the mentees to put into practice what they learn. We have a team of mentors who are experts in their fields and are willing to share their knowledge and experience with mentees.

## Why a Mentorship Program?
@spaceyatech is now one of the fastest growing tech communities in Kenya. This is down to the twitter spaces that we hold every Thursdays from 8PM EAT. 

The spaces revolve around a multitude of tech topics, from landing your first job in tech, to the current state of tech to the latest tech trends. 
We invite industry experts to share their knowledge and experience with the community.

As a result of this, we have had a lot of requests from people who want to join the tech industry but don't know where to start. We have also had requests from people who want to learn a new skill or improve on their current skillset. 

This is the why behind the mentorship program. A way to give back to the community and help people achieve their goals.

## Who were we targeting?
For the first cohort of the program, we targeted complete beginners who want to learn the fundamentals of web development. We decided to focus on web development because it is the most popular skillset in the tech industry and one of the most in-demand skills. Web development is a denominating factor in most tech jobs.
