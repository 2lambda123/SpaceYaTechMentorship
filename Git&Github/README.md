# Talking about Version control using Git

## What is Version control?

A sofware product will normally undergo multiple iterations before a full functional application is complete. This means that most of the time, what developers are actually doing is not only writing new code, but also rewriting old code.

This means that we spend just as much time debugging our code as we do writing it. The need for version control is in part because of this process of writing and rewriting your code. Sometimes we need to rollback our application to a previous version for one reason or the other. This is where version control comes in. Git is the most popular version control system. It allows us to track our application history as we develop our software.
